_Aggregation plugin_

#### current issues
- Algorithms make decisions about what content you have access to.
- Can we make a sorting / filtering / aggregation platform that is transparent and democratic?
- CC-only sites?
- When you read a physical newspaper you stumble upon surprising issues / topics
  * culture alongside politics, sports alongside art
- How can you collect

#### what is dangerous about aggregation?
- motives / algorithmic logic / priorities / agenda are not open
- 

#### tool building vs. prototyping
- 
- 

#### multilingual / multicultural interfaces
- We don't have to know, we have to cull / find our way.
- A 'Smarter Google' - one that does not tailor the filter to you but to the idea / topic.
- subject matrix 

#### prioritization of a news organization vs. it's users.
- Make aggregation and filtering transparent
- Surfacing content from other languages
- 

#### FILTERING
- space for new voices
- articles that are less shared / more shared.
- articles that were published longer ago / more recent
- articles that are more related / less related to current article
- citizen journalists vs. mainstream media
- people contribute sources / metadata about the sources
-  
- I don't want articles that people are reading already.
